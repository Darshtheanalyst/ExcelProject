This Excel project demonstrates my proficiency in **data cleaning, arrangement, and analysis**. 
The project involves the following steps:

**Data Cleaning**: Copied the raw data to a separate worksheet, checked for duplicates, and removed them. Modified the ‘Gender’ and ‘Marital Status’ columns using the ‘Find and Replace’ function to standardize the entries as ‘Male’/‘Female’ and ‘Married’/‘Single’. Adjusted the ‘Income’ column to remove decimals and use 000s separator for better readability. Changed ‘Commute Distance’ value ‘10+ miles’ to ‘Miles 10+’ for proper sorting.

**Data Grouping**: Introduced a separate column using the ‘Insert’ option and used a nested IF function to categorize people into ‘Adolescent’, ‘Middle-Aged’, and ‘Old’ based on their age group.

**Pivot Tables:** Created a separate worksheet ‘Pivot Table’ and used the Pivot Table option to create three different Pivot Tables based on ‘Income, Gender and outcome of the interaction’, ‘Commute Distance and outcome of the interaction’, and ‘Age-group and outcome of the interaction’.

**Data Visualization:** Used the ‘Chart’ option to create visualizations for all three tables and arranged these charts in a new ‘Dashboard’ worksheet.

**V-Lookup:** Inserted a new worksheet, ‘V Lookup Project’. Copied the ‘ID’ column and used it as a reference to insert two new columns, ‘Education’ and ‘Occupation’. Used the V Lookup function to pull the relevant data into these columns.

This project does not involve price details but instead focuses on the personal, miscellaneous data of individuals who approached the company to inquire about bikes and the outcome of those interactions. This project showcases my ability to effectively clean, arrange, and analyze data within Excel.
